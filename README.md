**Online Code Editor**

The **Online Code Editor** is a web-based platform designed to provide users with an interactive coding environment. The project facilitates code compilation and execution, supports multiple programming languages, and integrates a variety of features aimed at enhancing the coding experience, especially for learners.

#### **Key Features**

1. **Multi-language Support**:
   - Users can write, compile, and execute code in multiple programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more.
   - Language selection is available via a dropdown menu.

2. **Code Editor**:
   - A user-friendly, syntax-highlighted editor powered by **Angular** on the frontend.
   - Predefined syntax templates are provided for users to kickstart their coding, reducing boilerplate code efforts.
   - Integration with popular libraries like **CodeMirror** or **Monaco Editor** for a seamless coding experience.

3. **Real-time Compilation and Execution**:
   - Backend services built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** handle code compilation and execution.
   - The execution engine interfaces with compilers and interpreters to process the code and return output in real-time.

4. **AI-Powered Hint System** (using OpenAI services):
   - A dedicated **Get Hint** feature is powered by OpenAI services to offer context-sensitive guidance to users struggling to find the correct solution.
   - When users request a hint, the system generates helpful suggestions, examples, or even code snippets tailored to the problem.
   - This integration ensures intelligent, dynamic, and accurate assistance to enhance the learning process.

5. **Problem-Specific Pre-syntax**:
   - Each coding task or exercise includes predefined starter code to guide users.
   - This helps standardize the approach and reduce time spent setting up the solution.

6. **Code Evaluation**:
   - Users can submit their code for automated evaluation.
   - The backend provides test cases for validation, ensuring the solution meets the requirements.
   - Detailed feedback on errors or failed cases is given to help users improve.

7. **Secure and Scalable Architecture**:
   - Utilizes **Docker** containers to run code in an isolated environment, ensuring security and scalability.
   - Separate containers for each language ensure that execution environments are clean and consistent.

8. **User Accounts and Progress Tracking**:
   - User registration and login functionality with JWT-based authentication.
   - Users can save their progress, revisit previous solutions, and track performance over time.

9. **Frontend Built with Angular**:
   - The frontend offers a responsive and intuitive interface.
   - It includes features like live previews, draggable panes for input/output, and customizable themes (dark/light modes).

10. **Interactive Hints System**:
    - Powered by **OpenAI**, the **Get Hint** feature provides tiered guidance:
      - First hint: General explanation of the problem.
      - Second hint: Specific examples or code snippets.
      - Final hint: Nearly complete code solution with an explanation.
    - The AI model dynamically generates these hints based on the problem context, ensuring relevance and encouraging critical thinking.

11. **Database Integration with MongoDB**:
    - Problem sets, hints, and user data are stored in **MongoDB**.
    - The database schema ensures fast access and secure storage for real-time operations.

12. **Additional Features**:
    - Auto-save functionality for code drafts.
    - Collaboration tools for pair programming (future feature).
    - Performance analytics for educators and administrators to monitor user progress.
